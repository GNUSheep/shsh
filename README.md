# Overview

ShSh is a lightweight shell written in Rust. The inspiration behind this project came from my curiosity about creating a shell from scratch.

## Features

- Command History
- Environment Variables
- Tab Completion
- Pipeline Support
- Redirect stdout to file

In the neareast future I would like to have: 
- Reverse-i search in history
- GitHub repository plugin
- More custom commands

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/GNUSheep/shsh.git
cd shsh
cargo build --release
./target/release/shsh
```
